There are 8 words in the list to guess.

The program will:
1. Show a welcome message.
2. Ask you to enter 1 or 2.
   a) Once you enter a character, it will continue to run.
   b) If you input a character other than 1 and 2, it will tell you to re-enter a number. Back to step 2.
3. If you enter 2, it will quit.
4. If you enter 1, it will immediately start the game and tell you to enter a word.
   a) It will choose a random word for you to guess.
5. Once you enter 5 letters, it will immediately give you feedback on correctness.
   a) Note that it is impossible for you to enter more than 5 characters.
   b) If you press enter before you enter 5 characters, it will tell you to re-enter. Back to step 5.
6. If you entered the correct word, it will show a win message.
7. If you entered the wrong word, it will tell you how you were wrong.
   a) If you enter wrong words for 5 times, it will show a lose message and tell you the correct answer.
   b) Otherwise, it will tell you whether each letter is:
      - ' x ': not in the word
      - '(x)': in the word
      - '[x]': at the correct position
8. Go back to step 1.
